# Halo_ServiceDesk Module
Powershell wrapper for HaloPSA REST API

This was my first attempt at a HaloPSA REST wrapper for use in automation. I've moved on to a more advanced version internally so I'm making my (working) v1 code available for anyone who might need some basic functionality.

Cmdlets:

Connect-HaloPSA
.SYNOPSIS
	Connects to HaloPSA and gets a bearer token.
.EXAMPLE
	PS C:\> Connect-HaloPSA -ClientID "<your client ID>" -ClientSecret "<your client secret>"	
.NOTES
	This module requires you configure your HaloAPI integration to post as a user.

Get-Token
.SYNOPSIS
	Gets a bearer token via REST API .
.EXAMPLE
	PS C:\> Get-Token -ClientID 'value1' -ClientSecret 'value2'
